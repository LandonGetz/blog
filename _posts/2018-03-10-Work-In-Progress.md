Below is a collection of why I am starting this blog, what you can expect, and how I feel about it starting out.

## The Beginning

This is the beginning of a project. I've always wanted my writing to be good: there is something about an esteemed writer that is so appealing to me. That's really the goal that's at the heart of this blog. I wanted a project that I can make my own, that I can produce, edit, flesh out and create completely alone. I wanted a project that will help me focus by requiring a set amount of work from me every day or every week, and a project that would enhance my skills in one area or another. This blog is that project. Working on this can be as little or as much work as I can spare, and promises only to enhacne my writing ability (assuming I'm able to keep it up...).

> “The scariest moment is always just before you start.” 

Steven King wrote the above quote in his book <i>On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft</i>, and I can't think of a better why to describe why it's taken me so long to begin this project. Like most good millenials, I have always wanted to start a blog. This can be for many selfish reasons of course: sharing my life with others, forcing my thoughts on others, putting out content that will bring me attention. My hope, however, is that all these selfish reasons that one might start a blog (and some of these reasons apply to me as well), might coalesce into something a bit bigger. Something more, if you will.

I hope that this blog will become a place for me to put together ideas, thoughts, and feelings, and as such there might be plenty of half-baked ideas. Some might be bad-takes, some might be under-developed ideas, but that's what i'm going for. A set of writings that will help join together ideas, thoughts, and feelings into something more. Maybe this will appeal to others, maybe not, but if you do find yourself reading along with my writing, I hope that we may get somehting out of this writing together.

### Until next time
