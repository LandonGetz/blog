An explanation of why i'm starting this project, and sharing it with all of you!

## The Why

I've always wanted my writing to be good: there is something about an esteemed writer that is so appealing. That's really the goal that's at the heart of this blog. Working on this can be as little or as much work as I can spare, and promises only to make my writing better. I also wanted a project that I can make my own, that I can produce, edit, flesh out and create completely alone. I wanted a project that will help me focus by requiring a set amount of work from me every day or every week. This blog is that project.

## The Sharing

> “The scariest moment is always just before you start.” 

Steven King wrote the above quote in his book <i>On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft</i>, and I can't think of a better way to describe why it's taken me so long to begin this project. Like most good millenials, I have always wanted to start a blog, but putting yourself out in the open with one can be scary. However many selfish reasons there might be for starting a blog - sharing my life with others, forcing my thoughts on others, putting out content that will bring me attention - my hope is that my writing here can move beyond them, that my ramblings here might coalesce into something a bit bigger. Something more, if you will.

I hope that this blog will become a place for me to put together ideas, thoughts, and feelings, and as such there might be plenty of half-baked ideas. Some might be bad-takes, some might be under-developed ideas, but that's what i'm going for. A set of writings that will help join together ideas, thoughts, and feelings into something more. Maybe this will appeal to others, maybe not, but if you do find yourself reading along with my writing, I hope that we may get something out of this writing together.

## Until next time
