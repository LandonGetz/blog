Looking for a place to hear the stories of a queer scientist, baker, gardener, biotechnologist, and advocate? Well you are in the right place. 

I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at Dalhousie University (Halifax, NS, Canada), and am studying <i>Vibrio</i> spp. environmental survival and host-pathogen interactions. I work as a lecturer for Dalhousie's Chemistry department, am the external coordinator for the Dalhousie Urban Garden Society, work with Dalhousie's <b>i</b>nternational <b>G</b>enetically <b>E</b>ngineered <b>M</b>achine (iGEM) team, actively advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, and am an occasional bread baker.
