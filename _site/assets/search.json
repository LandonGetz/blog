        "content": "Published on Impact Ethics on August 24th, 2017.\n\nLandon J. Getz reflects on the current sexual abstention period within Canada for blood donations by men who have sex with men.\n\n\n\nDriving through Halifax during pride week, I noticed a Pride advertisement on the back of a city bus. It noted a headline from a Global News article titled: Canada’s limitations on gay blood donations ‘ridiculous’: HIV researchers. Currently, in Canada, men who have sex with men are prohibited from donating blood if they have had sex with a man in the year prior to their donation. Even though many LGBTQ advocates and HIV researchers are saying this deferral period on blood donation by men who have had sex with men is ‘ridiculous,’ Canadian Blood Services and Health Canada do not seem to agree. Approximately one year ago, the current 1-year deferral period policy replaced a 5-year deferral period. The anniversary of this policy change marks an opportunity to reflect on Canada’s blood donation policy and what it means for the LGBTQ community.\n\nHistorically, bans, deferral periods, and restrictions on blood donation by gay/bisexual men have been rooted in fear of harming patients by exposing them to contaminated blood. HIV was discovered in 1983, and from there new methods of diagnosis were discovered. Unfortunately, this did not stop HIV-infected blood from entering the blood supply, leading to what is known today as the “Tainted Blood Scandal.” Consequently, roughly 2000 Canadians were exposed to HIV via blood products in the early 1980s. However, a lack of policy and proper diagnostic testing procedures played important roles in this problem. While previously, diagnostic tests took months to diagnose HIV, modern tests can identify the virus in blood two weeks after exposure.\n\n\n  \n  Image Description: Halifax Pride Advertisement 2017.\n\n\nThis two-week window gets right at the root of why a 1-year deferral period for gay/bisexual men is no longer necessary from an infectious diseases perspective. Selecting this duration seems arbitrary when we have confidence that we can detect HIV infection within two weeks. So, the question here is why Canadian Blood Services continue to impose lengthy donation restrictions for men in this group when the risk of HIV contaminated blood entering the blood supply exists only for two weeks after sexual contact. Canadian Blood Services states that their reason for maintaining the 1-year deferral period is that gay/bisexual men make up the largest proportion of individuals newly infected with HIV. However, sexual behaviours among gay/bisexual men vary greatly, and certain behaviours can significantly reduce an individual’s risk of exposure to HIV. Examples include having protected sex (using condoms), being in a monogamous relationship where both partners are HIV negative, and avoiding sexual encounters with anonymous individuals. While the statistics tell us that gay/bisexual men are the most likely to become infected with HIV, it does not mean that all men who have sex with men are at a high risk for HIV exposure. As well, Canadian Blood Services tests all donated blood samples via modern diagnostic tests for infectious disease contamination. If contamination does occur, the screening process prevents it from entering the blood supply.\nFor an organization whose slogans focus on how we can each give life, it is worrisome that a portion of the population is restricted from doing so by policy that, at best, seems no longer necessary. Especially considering the current blood shortage issues in Canada, we need to ensure that any prohibition on donation is for reasons that are worthy. The current policy seems to fail here because diagnostic testing has improved, such that HIV can be detected in the blood within two weeks of infection. Also, the risk of contaminating the blood supply with HIV can be reduced by screening for certain sexual behaviours, rather than simply screening on the basis of sexual orientation.\n    \nReplacement of the 1-year deferral period is necessary because gay/bisexual men are interested in donating blood and not all are at increased risk for HIV infection. Further, gay/bisexual men are already stigmatized and policy that does not accurately reflect risks acts to further this stigma. The facts tell us a shorter abstention period from risky sexual practices would be sufficiently long to ensure a safe blood supply. Even further, for individuals who are taking appropriate precautions when it comes to protected sex, or who have been in long-term, HIV-negative, monogamous relationships, it hardly seems appropriate to have a deferral period at all. For a future of blood donation that is more based on facts, Canadian Blood Services must understand that current policy is not a worthwhile solution to infection control. As well, future statistics collected on HIV infections should be focused on sexual practices and behaviours rather than simply on sexual orientation. Finally, blood donation for men who have sex with men is already changing in places around the world. Canada's blood donation policy has changed before, and it is time for it to change again.\n\n\n\n\nLandon J.

        "content": "Published on Impact Ethics on May 11th, 2018.\n\nLandon J. Getz explores the privacy minefield of commercial DNA Sequencing, and how it has become relevant in recent news.\n\n\n\nDeoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, has been known as the hereditary material in living cells since 1944. It was discovered, in part, by Halifax-born Oswald Avery. Since being discovered, scientists have made significant progress in figuring out how DNA is manufactured, copied, and used by living cells. Most importantly, in the last decade we have become remarkably good at “sequencing” the genetic code: decoding the DNA molecules so that we can read the genetic blueprint, much like one would translate a book from one language to another.\n\nBeing able to sequence DNA has provided many opportunities for researchers and clinicians alike to understand the nature and likelihood of some hereditary diseases. It has also allowed us to identify persons who are genetically-related to one another. Databases, both public and private, are being built to collect and store this genetic data. Examples include private companies like 23andMe and AncestryDNA, along with public databases like GEDMatch.\n\nA variety of privacy and intimate-information issues stem from obtaining and storing personal DNA sequence information. For example, AncestryDNA provides a genetic heritage analysis, allowing an individual to learn where their DNA tells them they are from. (It should be noted that the ability of these tests to identify heritage correctly has been called into question). This information can be shared with others, dependent on the privacy selections an individual makes on their profile. It is essential that customers ensure their privacy settings are as they want them to be, to ensure their data stays private (if that’s what they wish).\n\n\n  \n  Playing with Code Fire; by Ade McOran-Campbell (2011). Image description: Painting of person sitting cross-legged in a field, with the sun overhead. Person is playing with a double helix.\n\n\nIn addition, companies that collect genetic information to determine health risks – if you are a cystic fibrosis carrier for example – can learn things about themselves that they may otherwise wish not to know, or would want to keep out of the hands of others (e.g. insurance companies). Most strikingly, you not only learn your own health risks, but inadvertently you learn about your parents’ and relatives’ genetic codes as well. Your genetic code is hereditary after-all, meaning you receive your genes (and their associated health-risks) from your parents.\n\nRecently, a suspect in a string of sexual assaults and murders in the United States was identified by police through a DNA sequence match on GEDMatch.com. GEDMatch works by allowing individuals to upload their personal genetic information to the database, in the hopes of identifying genealogical information. Police, undoubtedly through a genetic genealogist, used DNA samples collected at the crime scene to link the suspect to a family member who had uploaded their information to GEDMatch. This provided the police with the information they needed to make an arrest. This example highlights an additional use of publicly available genetic information that many people were unaware of. This particular example is worrying. Although the end in this case – catching and subduing a suspected serial killer and rapist – was undeniably good, the family member who uploaded their DNA sequence to GEDMatch was likely unaware of how it would be used. This ultimately puts the family member in the position of “genetic informant” without their knowledge. As such, this particular case has raised many questions about how police should be able to use genealogy websites and their associated data. Further issues are raised by the fact that the use of DNA sequences in this way is not always accurate. DNA evidence was used to link a San Francisco film-maker to a murder that police later found out he did not commit.\n\nCanadian law currently prevents the use of genetic information to discriminate for housing, employment and insurance, with significant criminal consequences if that law is violated. Canadians, however, are only covered by this law while in Canada. This does not prevent genetic information from being used for a variety of other things by private companies in other countries. David Fraser, a Halifax privacy lawyer, issued a warning in a 2018 CBC interview that “this is some of the most sensitive information that exists,” and that not everyone considers the implications of DNA testing. In writing this, I wished to echo that statement: DNA testing provides a wealth of information that can be used in a variety of ways, both good and bad.\n\nHowever, it is important that consumers are aware of what they are getting into and what the private companies will do with their information once the DNA sequencing is complete. Ultimately, understanding these details allows consumers to make informed decisions about this extremely personal information.\n\n\nLandon J. Getz is a M.Sc.

        "content": "Published on Impact Ethics on October 26th, 2018.\n\nLandon J. Getz provides an update on Canadian Blood Services’ progress in updating outmoded policies on gay blood donation.\n\n\nIn the past year Canadian Blood Services, and Health Canada, have made little progress on their blood donation policies for gay men. The Liberal Party of Canada made significant promises to the LGBTQ+ community in terms of the gay blood ban and have yet to deliver on these promises. As an update to the previous article here on Impact Ethics, I will begin by covering a quick history on the blood ban in Canada, move into what changes we have seen on this issue in the past year, and end on what needs to be done to improve the state of Canadian policy.\n\nCurrently, Canadian Blood Services requires a one-year sexual abstention period for gay and bisexual men (men who have sex with other men) prior to donating blood. Importantly, this policy has been updated from the five-year gay blood-ban and the previous lifetime ban. Largely, these policies stem from the AIDS crisis, and the Tainted Blood Scandal that occurred around the world and in Canada, respectively. The public was worried about contracting HIV from the blood donations of gay men, and Health Canada responded.\n\nImage description: red blood cells\n\nIt has been a bit over two years since Canada moved from the five-year blanket ban to the one-year deferral period. Since that time, many advocacy groups and an E-petition have argued that the 1-year ban is still not backed by science. Largely, this is because they argue, and I agree, that a blanket ban on gay blood does not accurately reflect who is a “high-risk” HIV donor. Further, this can perpetuate the idea that gay men are sick/carry disease, which leads to further stigmatization and “othering” of this group. Canadian Blood Services has noted that they are reviewing research in order to safely lower the one-year ban to a three-month ban (in line with the current UK policy), and have conducted focus groups in considering a behavioural-based approach to screening. Behavioural-based approaches are those which screen blood donors not on their sexuality, but on the behaviours which put them at risk for HIV infection.\n\nHere’s what the science says. Many of the tests available for HIV detection have sensitivities and specificities that approach 100%, meaning that missing a contaminated sample is very unlikely after the window of detection (two-weeks from infection). Further, previous reductions in blood-bans have not resulted in significant increases in blood contamination. In fact, a study in 2013 showed that when the UK changed their policy from a five-year to a one-year deferral in 2011, the number of blood contamination increased only marginally – to one contaminated sample every 455 years – while it made 46% of men who have sex with men eligible for blood donation. More importantly, reduction to the three-month deferral period is working well for the UK.\n\nItaly and Spain have implemented behavioural-based screening approaches, which have been supported by the American Red Cross and American Association of Blood Banks, and screen all individuals (including gay men) into “low-risk” and “high-risk” groups based on their sexual behaviours. For example, individuals who are in long-term monogamous relationships, or practice regular safe sex, are unlikely to have contracted HIV that would be undetectable at the time of donation and are therefore labelled “low-risk”. On the other hand, individuals who have unprotected sex, or are engaged in anonymous sexual encounters, are more likely to have contracted HIV and are labelled “high-risk”. Currently, this approach is working in Italy and Spain and increases the number of eligible donors while preventing the further stigmatization of gay men.\n\nA behavioural-based approach is the ideal option for reducing the stigmatization of gay blood, as well as increasing the number of potential donors, while still protecting the blood supply from HIV contamination. Canadian advocates, including BloodWatch, support a decrease in the deferral period to three-months, but agree that a behavioural-based approach is preferable. Importantly, the diagnostic tests which currently screen for HIV are incredibly robust tools, and with proper donor screening and blood testing, Canadian Blood Services can ensure that supplies remain safe.\n\nMost importantly, as I have argued before, Canadian Blood Services needs to work quickly to implement better policy as blood shortages continue to be a problem. It is my, and others, hope that this policy can change soon, and Canada can become a world-leader in blood donation policy for gay men. Gay blood ban policies are based in an outdated and unsupported fear of blood donation from gay men. Therefore, we must work faster to update our policies to ensure our blood donation policies so as to prevent stigmatization, as well as ensure that our blood supply remains safe, and our policies are backed by science.\n\n\nLandon J.

        "content": "\n\nFrançoise Baylis, Professor and Canada Research Chair in Bioethics and Philosophy, Dalhousie University; Graham Dellaire, Director of Research and Professor of Pathology, Dalhousie University, and Landon J Getz, Ph.D. Candidate in Microbiology and Immunology, Dalhousie University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Read the original article.\n\n\nThe media is buzzing with the surprise news that a Chinese researcher, Jainkui He, has created the world’s first genome-edited twins. He did this, ostensibly, to provide resistance to HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.\n\nProf. He, reportedly working with former Rice University supervisor Michael Deem, capitalized on work in 2012 by Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuel Charpentier, who introduced a new and easier way of altering the DNA of human and non-human organisms using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. He also built upon the work of molecluar biologist Feng Zhang, who optimized this genome editing system for use in human cells.\n\nHe’s claim moves human germline genome editing from the lab to the delivery room   — something other scientists might have been thinking about despite ethical concerns.\n\n\n  \n\n\nThe scientific community has expressed widespread condemnation of He’s decision to initiate a pregnancy using genetically modified embryos   — as “dangerous, “irresponsible” and “crazy.” What if mistakes are made? How can we be sure this powerful technology will benefit humankind? Are we ready for the consequences of genetically engineering our own evolution?\n\nWe argue that we cannot allow individual scientists to decide the fate of the human genome. Heritable human genome editing poses a significant existential threat because changes may persist throughout the human population for generations, with unknown risks.\n\nWe must commit to inclusive global dialogue   — involving experts and the public   — to develop broad societal consensus on what to do with genetic technologies.\n\nPossible mutations or forced sterilization\n\nHe announced to the world that he edited the genome of human embryos for seven couples using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. According to He, two of these embryos resulted in a pregnancy, and twin girls (Lulu and Nana, which are pseudonyms) were born.\n\nThe goal of the editing was to confer resistance to HIV by modifying the CCR5 gene (the protein doorway by which HIV enters human cells). He claims that these edits have been verified in both twins and this data has been looked over and called “probably accurate” by George Church, a world-renowned Harvard geneticist.\n\nEvidence suggests, however, the procedure was unnecessary, is unlikely to provide benefit and could even cause harm. Although the father of Lulu and Nana was HIV positive, it is unlikely that he would have passed this disease to his children using standard IVF procedures.\n\nThe children born of genome editing are genetic mosaics with uncertain resistance to HIV and perhaps decreased resistance to viral diseases like influenza and West Nile. This is because the CCR5 gene that He disabled plays an important role in resistance to these diseases.\n\nAs well, there is the possibility of unintended mutations caused by the CRISPR procedure. These health risks cannot be overstated, as the repercussions for these twin girls, in terms of their susceptibility to infectious diseases or cancer will likely be a cause for concern throughout their lives.\n\nAnother uncertain consequence for the twins concerns their reproductive health and freedom. As they approach reproductive age will they face the possibility of “forced” sterilization to prevent their edited genes being passed on to future generations?\n\nMultiple investigations\n\nThe Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, where He is employed (currently on leave from February 2018 to January 2021), has distanced itself from the researcher and will form an independent international committee to investigate the widely publicized, controversial research.\n\n\n  \n  Feng Zhang, center, an institute member of Harvard and MIT’s Broad Institute, reacts to reporters on the issue of world’s first genetically edited babies after the Human Genome Editing Conference in Hong Kong on Nov. 27, 2018. (AP Photo/Vincent Yu)\n\n\nRice University, where Michael Deem is employed, has also said they will investigate.\n\nThe Shenzhen HarMoniCare Women’s and Children’s Hospital launched an inquiry into the validity of the ethics documents provided by He documenting research ethics approval.\n\nImportantly, the ethics approval was only uploaded to the Chinese Clinical Trial Database on Nov. 8 as a retrospective registration   — likely around the time that the twins were purportedly born.\n\nDesigner babies by powerful elites\n\nWith the Genetic Genie out of the bottle, we have to ask whether we need any more time to reflect on the ethics?\n\nA just and fair society is one with less disparity and more justice. A predictable consequence of allowing (nay, encouraging) individuals to genetically modify their children will be greater disparity and greater injustice   — and not only because of limited access to genome editing technology.\n\nOf significant concern is the inevitable increase in discrimination, stigmatization and marginalization as powerful scientific and corporate elites decide which traits are desirable and which traits are not.\n\nAlthough He disavows any interest in so-called “designer babies” whose parents have chosen their children’s eye-colour, hair-colour, IQ and so on, we are forced to contemplate such a “eugenic” dystopian future should we continue down this path.\n\nThe human genome belongs to all of us. As such, we need to commit to the hard work of making good on the 2015 admonition by the Organizing Committee for the International Summit on Human Gene Editing to work towards “broad societal consensus” on how we should proceed with, or not proceed with, editing it.\n\nIn this regard it is heartwarming to have Feng Zhang call for a moratorium on implantation of edited embryos and remind his scientific colleagues that “in 2015, the international research community said it would be irresponsible to proceed with any germline editing without ‘broad societal consensus about the appropriateness of the proposed application.’”\n\n\n\nDisclosure statement\n\nFrançoise Baylis has received funding from the Canadian Institute of Health Research and the Canada Research Chairs Program.\nGraham Dellaire receives funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).\nLandon J Getz receives funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "excerpt": "I’ve long argued that Canadian Blood Services and Health Canada’s current regulation regarding the Gay Blood Ban is misguided. Is Health Canada getting it wrong again with the Assisted Human Reproduction Act?\n",
        "content": "I’ve long argued that Canadian Blood Services and Health Canada’s current regulation regarding the Gay Blood Ban is misguided. The Liberal Government has failed in promises to “end” the gay blood ban in Canada, and instead reinforced it by downgrading the ban from 5 years to 1 year. To me, reducing the ban still says that blood coming from Gay men is risky. This is not the message we got in 2015.\n\nHealth Canada is working on amendments to the Assisted Human Reproduction Act. These amendements, among others, include changes to the deferment period for gay men sperm donation. There has been a lot of media attention regarding the gay blood ban since 2015, however much less attention has been given to the changes to sperm donation rules.\n\nThe reported changes will see a gay men sperm donation lifetime ban reduced to a deferment period of 6 months (see 2.1.1(l)) following a sexual encounter with another man. This change is an obvious step in the right direction. But as the headline at DailyXTRA reads, it still “continues anti-gay discrimination”.\n\nI can’t help but ask myself where Health Canada came up with the 6-month number. The HIV virus is rarely transmitted via semen in patients with low blood virus counts. In fact, if patients are treated and achieve undetectable viral counts in the blood, risk of sexual transmission is practically zero. Further, as I have argued before, men who have sex with men are not automatically at higher-risk for HIV infection. However, certain behaviours - such as promiscuous, anonymous, or unprotected sex - can increase your risk of HIV infection regardless of your sexual orientation. Countries in Europe, notably Italy and Spain, have begun screening blood donation patients based on behaviours, rather than a blanket sexual-orientation based ban.\n\n\n\nA 6-month deferment on sperm donation for men doesn’t follow Health Canada’s current policy on the deferment period for gay blood donation (1 year currently), and Health Canada has not (to the best of my knowledge) explained this distinction. Considering Spain and Italy have had no “public-health crisis” as a result of behavioural-based screening, and that the American Red Cross and American Association of Blood Banks support this approach, I’m surprised Health Canada is so weary about gay blood and sperm donation.\n\nToday (December 2nd, 2018) is Health Canada’s day to consult the people of Halifax on the proposed changes to the Assisted Human Reproduction Act. I have the following questions for Health Canada regarding the proposed changes for sperm donation:\n\n\n    What evidence do you have that a 6-month ban for sperm donation is appropriate?\n    Why the disconnect between Health Canada's policy on gay blood donation vs. gay sperm donation?\n    How do you intend to rectify this disconnect?\n\n\nI hope that we can work together to build a world that we will be proud to live in. It is up to the Government of Canada to lead efforts to reduce discrimination towards LGBTQ+ folks in society. To achieve that, we must work towards removing bans and deferment periods based on sexual-orientation blanket bans for both blood donations and sperm donations.\n",

        "content": "Looking back at 2018 gives me a lot to think about. These reflections shine light on some of these thoughts: what went well, what didn’t, how I can do/be better in 2019. Instead of setting hard goals, i’m looking to set themes for 2019. This way, I don’t have to gauge myself on a black and white scale (achieved goal or didn’t achieve goal), but rather can give myself food for thought to answer the above questions again on December 31st, 2019.\n\nWhat Went Well:\n\nThis year was pretty productive as far as work goes. I participated in 3 conferences, published 3 papers (2 first-author) and 4 commentaries at publications including The Conversation, The Halifax Chronicle Herald, The National Post, The Hastings Centre Forum Blog, and Impact Ethics. I was hired as a Part-Time Academic to teach the First-Year Chemistry course at Dalhousie University, and have greatly enjoyed working with that team. A first this year, I was invited onto the Information Morning Radio Show with Host Portia Clark to discuss being LGBTQ in STEM. This followed my twitter thread about LGBTSTEMDay on June 4th, and was an honour!\n\nToday is the first annual #LGBTSTEMDay! So, naturally, I need to write a small thread to share my story/feelings/understanding with friends and colleagues...being an #LGBTQIA STEM student isn&#39;t always easy #phdchat pic.twitter.com/JfjRgyU0mi&mdash; Landon Getz (@LandonGetz) July 5, 2018\n\n\nFinally, I participated in 2 Science Communication platforms, Dal Science’s Ask a Scientist Campaign and Halifax’s first Science Slam! These events challenged me personally and professionally and I can’t wait for the #scicomm I do in the future.\n\nI also had a pretty successful year in home baking! I succeeded in making croissants for the first time just last week, made Ramen from a book I got for Christmas, perfected some of my sourdough and conventional bread-making techniques, nailed some home-made pizzas (long fermented dough for incredible flavour) and I discovered tea-cakes (i’m obsessed).\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Landon Getz (@landgetz) on Dec 29, 2018 at 12:25pm PST \n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Landon Getz (@landgetz) on Mar 25, 2018 at 2:02pm PDT \n\n\nWhat Didn't\n\nThis year brought a few firsts, but the most striking was the loss of my first close family member. I’ve been lucky up until now to not have lost anyone I was close to, but my Grandma Shirley passed away this last spring. Losing family members is hard, and I can say that I wasn’t expecting the “gut-punch” that it would actually be.\n\nHere’s my grandmother, recently passed, living her life as a powerful woman with grace and love. pic.twitter.com/NvHhzvqdRW&mdash; Landon Getz (@LandonGetz) March 8, 2018\n\n\nMy work-life balance took a bit of a hit this year, with a lot of stress and time put into work. It paid off, in terms of outcomes, but I now understand that this rushed pace makes my actions less considered, and potentiates mistakes.\n\nHow Can I Do/Be Better\n\nAlright, let’s talk themes. My themes for next year include:\n\n\n    The Slow Movement\n    Science Communication and Outreach\n    Community Growth\n\n\n1. The Slow Movement\n\nThe Slow Movement started in Food and Agribusiness in Italy:\n\nThe Slow Food movement has its origins in the 1980s in Italy.  When McDonald’s planned to build an franchise outlet near the Piazza di Spagna in Rome in 1986, Carlo Petrini organised a demonstration in which he and his followers brandished bowls of penne as weapons of protest.  Their demonstration was successful and soon after, Carlo founded the International Slow Food Movement which runs counter to the fast food, fast life, non-sustainable food production and the eroding of local economies.\n\nEssentially, although i’ll admit i’ve only dabbled here slightly, the argument is that moving slower (distinguised from doing less, which is not really the argument) allows people to think, prepare, and act deliberatly. This is done by forging connectedness and rejecting the fast pace of modern life.\n\nIf you are interested, this movement has been explored in a few books The Slow Professor: Challenging the Culture of Speed in the Academy by Barbara K. Seeber and Maggie Berg (which I am currently reading!) and In Praise of Slow : How a Worldwide Movement Is Challenging the Cult of Speed by Carl Honore (which is on my reading list!).\n\n2. Science Communication and Outreach\n\nI won’t belabour this point. I am hoping to continue to push my comfort zone this year and spread scientific knowledge to the public. It can be hard to do, and i’m only just beginning, but i’m looking forward to continuing this work into the future.\n\n3. Community Growth\n\nI will admit, there is one goal at the heart of this theme. I am looking to build an LGBTQ+ STEM event at Dalhousie this year, as a precursor event to a full Atlantic Canadian LGBTQ STEM Conference in 2020. This will involve meeting and learning for a variety of people in my community (and outside it). This, along with continued work at Urban Gardens/Farms around Halifax, I hope to grow my personal community and the communities i’m apart of in 2019.\n\nConclusions:\n\n2018 had it’s ups and downs, but I definitely appreciate the time I can take to reflect on it. Moving onward into 2019, I hope you can take some time to reflect too. Happy New Years folks!\n",

Like others, whose feelings I surveyed after the event, I have a hard time explaining how incredible the day was.\n\nThis event allowed us to be our complete selves, without concern for our safety, how we might be percieved, and whether attaching our queerness to science will negatively effect our careers. I have never been to a conference quite like it - least of all a conference with as much laughter and joy - and it was incredible, not to mention the quality of the science, which included astrophysics, machine learning, molecular biology, disease ecology, and glaciology.\n\nDay 6 in the UK:- One of the most profound experiences of my lifetime (#LGBTSTEMinar19)Thanks for making it such a success everyone!&mdash; Landon Getz (@LandonGetz) January 11, 2019\n\n\nToday still, regular academic conferences are  not a safe place for LGBTQ+ minorities; moreso for Trans/Non-binary folks than others. Occassionally they might be “technically” safe spaces, but are not inclusive, with the lack of correct pronoun usage and rampant heteronormativity. The LGBTSTEMinar fills a massive gap in current Science meetings. For LGBTQ+ minorities, it allows the celebration of science without the trouble these minorities often experience in largely straight crowds. Further, events like the LGBTSTEMinar allow LGBTQ+ folks in STEM to identify and find their communtiy within STEM.\n\nI have to say I got a bit choked up when I walked in &amp; saw this massive rainbow 🌈It overwhelmed me to walk into a room &amp; feel so immediately validated &amp; completely welcome.Thank you so so so much to everyone involved in all the organisation.#LGBTSTEMinar19 pic.twitter.com/G279kQaZzP&mdash; Niamh Kavanagh (@NiamhTalking90) January 11, 2019\n\n\nMy intention for travelling overseas for this event was mostly reconnaisance. Atlantic Canada suffers from the same problem, and in my experience does not have a strong LGBT community in STEM. It’s my intention to fix that by bringing a version of the LGBTSTEMinar to the Maritime provinces. I hope that someday events like this might be commonplace, so scientists can celebrate science and queerness together.\n\nLeaving London today has me a bit overwhelmed. The folks I met this last week were all incredible and I can’t wait to return to catch up with them at another STEMinar. The LGBTSTEMnar was easily one of the most impactful events i’ve been to in my lifetime.\n\n",

        "content": "For the educators in the room, have you ever had undergraduate classes that refuse to engage with your course content? I’ve been thinking a lot about those students, and wondering how we can change our teaching to help them engage more actively.\n\nThis week, I attended the Dalhousie Conference on University Teaching and Learning. This is the largest conference in Canada that deals with University teaching and learning and had over 150 participants and 52 presentations (unfortunately with too many concurrent sessions for me to see everything).\n\nFYI - a few stats for #dcutl19 - 52 presentations (including two plenaries), by 108 authors, with almost 180 participants including over 20 students.  Thanks to all for being here!&mdash; Brad Wuetherick (@bwuetherick) May 2, 2019\n\n\nThe conference this year was focused on active learning, a project which the centre for learning and teaching at Dalhousie university has working on this past year. Active learning is the process of more actively engaging students in the learning process. This can be done a number of ways, through activities like Think-Pair-Share, group exams, group work, clicker questions, group discussion and so on. (As an aside, if you are wondering what a group exam is or how it is administered, I am planning a future blog post on this topic!) These activities are designed to help students be a bit more active in the classroom, rather than just listen to a lecture for which they will lose focus after about 10 minutes.\n\nI had the pleasure of speaking at this conference, but about something a bit more specific. I understand the requirement for active learning in the classroom, and I understand the benefits, but I wondered, “Would I have engaged in the active learning process during my undergrad?” I worried that, especially in my first year, I would have been far too uncomfortable to do so. Let’s back up so I can explain.\n\nAt #dcutl19 listening to @LandonGetz speak of his experiences of LGBTQ+ 🏳️‍🌈 inclusivity in STEM classrooms. pic.twitter.com/i2sp2fy3ta&mdash; Les TJ (@drlestj) May 1, 2019\n\n\nI came out to my family as gay in the fall of my first year of University. This came with a period of very personal and emotional stress. Entering into the classroom environment in this state, I felt very uncomfortable and very tense. Because of this, I think I would’ve been very unlikely to participate well in any of the aforementioned active learning activity.\n\nMy talk at the DCUTL conference was titled “Creating LGBTQ+ Inclusive Spaces for Equitable Active Learning.” My key message was that students who do not feel comfortable in their surroundings are unlikely to participate in the active learning process. I drew on my personal experiences in my first year to explain this discomfort and how an educator might help alleviate that discomfort.\n\nThe primary “action items” I asked people to consider including in their classrooms were the following:\n\n\n  Inclusion of Pronouns\n\n\nMy purpose here was to encourage the normalizing of pronoun usage in the classroom. Introducing yourself, as the instructor, with pronouns at the beginning of the semester signals to LGTBQ+ students that you are aware of them and you are a supportive individual. The same is achieved through the inclusion of pronouns in email signatures and in class syllabi. These small actions help non-binary and trans students to identify their pronouns in class without feeling singled out or alone.\n\n\n  Become a “Visible Ally”\n\n\nMy second suggestion is what I’m referring to as “Visible Allyship.” This essentially means that it is not enough to simply be an ally, your students also need to know that you are an ally. This can be done through the use of small things like rainbow pins, rainbow flags, and other LGBTQ+ identifying paraphernalia. Importantly, these small objects, when hanging in your office or classroom, signal to LGBTQ+ students that this is a space where they are welcome.\n\nThis has been my experience anecdotally. My current PhD supervisor, then honours supervisor, has a “celebrate diversity” pin on his office cork board. When I first met him to discuss doing research, I saw the pin, knew I was in a safe space without having to broach the subject directly. This takes an enormous amount of stress off of the student and made me immediately more comfortable in that environment.\n\n\n  \n  The very same Celebrate Diversity pin that my supervisor had (has) in his office. (Dal.ca)\n\n\n\n  Classroom Code of Conducts\n\n\nThis is a big one. Much like conferences should always have an explicit code of conduct, which explains what behaviours are not acceptable during the conference, so to should the classroom have a code of conduct. These documents can be short, and signal to students that they have entered into a location where their peers are expected to engage in respectful and courteous ways with you and others within the classroom environment. This can include statements like:\n\n\n  “We expect all classroom participants to treat each other with dignity and to conduct themselves in a proper and professional manner.”\n\n    “Harassment and sexist, racist, homophobic, or exclusionary jokes will not be tolerated”\n\n\n\nThese codes of conduct should be made explicit on day one, and be included in the syllabus. It is also a good idea to have a plan for what the students should do if this code of conduct is breached, and make that explicit in your syllabus as well.\n\n\n  Highlight LGBTQ+ Staff, Faculty, and Students (when appropriate).\n\n\nFor many LGBTQ+ youth, finding role models is hard. This is especially true in traditionally heterosexual and cis-gendered environments like Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. For this reason, I think it is incredibly beneficial to students to highlight those in your programs (and beyond) that identify as a member of a minority group. Doing this allows students to find role models, and recongize the folks they can be immediately open with and ask questions (about being LGBTQ+ in STEM).\n\nA word of caution. DO NOT highlight LGBTQ+ staff, faculty, or students without express consent from them. It is possible for a staff member to be open with their immediate workplace, but not want their identity on speakerphone to the whole institution (or beyond). Without express consent, it is quite easy to accidentally out a faculty member to their family/friends and this can be EXTREMELY harmful. Just ask before you highlight anyone.\n\nMy talk was designed to offer these suggestions to make the classroom a more equitable place for all to feel comfortable engaging in the active learning process. I hope that some other educators can find these suggestions useful in navigating what can be a complex classroom environment, and make sure that all students feel welcome.\n\nA final note: remember that sometimes it’s not what you say, it’s what you don’t say. I believe that most educators are not EXPLICITLY making an unwelcoming environment for students. However, without active signals that the classroom is a welcome place for LGBTQ+ students, they may feel uncomfortable regardless. Be mindful of how environments might feel for diverse students and use these 4 suggestions to more actively make the classroom comfortable for LGBTQ+ students.\n\n",
